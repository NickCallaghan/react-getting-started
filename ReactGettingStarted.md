## Let's Get Started

### 1 - Using create react app. 
Using create react app will set you up a default starter project with a boilerplate code. 
```terminal 
mkdir my-project-dir
npx create-react-app my-project-dir
```
Open up the project up in your code editor

### 2 - Installing Node Modules
If you are using a git repo which which you have cloned from the internet you will need to install any dependencies. These are listed in the `package.json` file. You can install them by running:
```
npm i
```

Today we are going to install react boot strap by running:
```
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

### 3 - Staring the dev server
