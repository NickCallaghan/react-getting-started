**There different branches have been set up against this repo if you want to skip to a particular step then just switch to the branch corresponding to each step**

### Prerequisites

- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (12.18.3 or greater)
- Google Chrome Browser
- Git installed - [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a good option for this on the mac
- [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en#:~:text=React%20Developer%20Tools%20is%20a,%22%20and%20%22%E2%9A%9B%EF%B8%8F%20Profiler%22.)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or other code editor)
- Some HTML/CSS/JavaScript knwoledge is recommended before beginning with react. It's possible to learn all at once but it will be a bit of a learning curve

## Setting up a project from scratch

### 1 - Using create react app.

Using create react app will set you up a default starter project with a boilerplate code.

```terminal
mkdir my-project-dir
npx create-react-app my-project-dir
```

Open up the project up in your code editor

### 2 - Installing Node Modules

If you are using a git repo which which you have cloned from the internet you will need to install any dependencies. These are listed in the `package.json` file. You can install them by running, from the root of you project:

```
npm i
```

Today we are going to install react boot strap by running:

```
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

### 3 - Staring the dev server

The react dev server runs a devlopment versions of your app. It has hot reloading so if you chnage the code the app will re-load. From the root of you project run:

```
npm start
```
